Assignment 4 Pandas Challenge



Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


PyCity Pandas Challenge Anlysis

- PyCity Schools provided district wide test results for analysis. The data was combined, and the following results were observed. 

--- The district includes 15 schools teaching 39,170 students with a budget of $24,649,428. 65 percent of current students are passing both reading and math. The highest performing schools by overall percentage are Cabera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Peena. These schools all are above a 90 percent passing overall. The bottom performing schools have an overall passing percentage of 52 to 53 and are Rodriguez, Figueroa, Huang, Hernandez, and Johnson. 

The spending rate per student was analyzed. The lowest bracket of spending was less than $585 and led to an Overall Passing rate of 90 percent. The highest spending bracket was $645-$680 with an Overall Passing rate of 53 percent. 

School size was broken into Small (<1000), Medium (1000-2000), Large (2000-5000). Small and medium size schools provided 89 and 90 percent passing rates, respectively. While the Large schools averaged a 58 percent overall passing rate. 

The final breakdown of the district data was by school type. Charter schools had an overall passing percentage of 90 while District schools averaged a 53 percent overall passing rate. Breaking this down further, Charter schools had similar Math and Reading passing rates at 93 and 96 percent. District schools had a 66 percent passing rate for Math and an 80 percent passing rate for Reading. 

There is a gap between the Overall Passing rates of the Charter and District schools, with the Charter schools having a 37 percent greater success rate. This gap is worth further investigation to determine what the cause of the type of school and how they do things may have a significant effect on the scores. One thing to note with this breakdown is the Math passing rates at the District schools are 66 bringing down the pass rate. The Reading for district is at passing at 80 percent with a similar Average reading score as the Charter schools, 80.9 vs 83.

School size appears to play a large factor in the Overall Passing. The Small and Medium size classes had similar scores and passing percentages at 89, while the Large schools of between 2000 and 5000 students drooped to a 58 percent.
